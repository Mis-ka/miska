# About me
After spending almost 10 years working in logistics 🚚, I have found myself in need of switching to a field that allows me to create.🧑‍🎨 

**I want to create. I like working on solutions. And I like brainstorming with my team.**

**I think I have natural ability of picking up on language nuances and since coding consists of languages I have submerged myself into the world of dev.**
